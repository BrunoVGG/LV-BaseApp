## <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" >About Laravel</a>About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects.


## <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" >About Vue</a>

<p>Vue (pronounced <code>/vjuÀê/</code>, like view) is a <strong>progressive framework</strong> for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.</p>
